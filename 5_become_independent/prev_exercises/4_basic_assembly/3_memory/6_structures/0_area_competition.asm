; 0.  Area competition.

    ; For every rectangle R which is parallel to the X and Y axes, we can
    ; represent R using two points.
	
    ; Example:
  
      ; A------------B
      ; |     R      |
      ; |            |
      ; D------------C

      ; We could represent the rectangle in the drawing using the points A(x,y)
      ; and C(x,y) for example. Basically, we need 4 numbers to represent this
      ; kind of rectangle: 2 coordinates for A, and 2 coordinates for C.

      ; I remind you that the area of a rectangle is computed as the
      ; multiplication of its height by its width.


    ; Write a program that takes the coordinates of two rectangles (2 points or 4
    ; dwords for each rectangle), and then finds out which rectangle has the
    ; larger area.

    ; The program then outputs 0 if the first rectangle had the largest area, or 1
    ; if the second rectangle had the largest area. 

    ; In addition, the program prints the area of the rectangle that won the area
    ; competition.
