; 3.  Common number.

; Create a program that takes a number n as input, followed by a list of n
; numbers b_1, b_2, ... b_n. You may assume that 0x0 <= b_i <= 0xff for every
; 1 <= i <= n.

; The program will output the most common number.

; Example:

; Assume that the input was n=7, followed by the list: 1,5,1,3,5,5,2.
; The program will output 5, because this is the most common number.

; Note that if there is more than one most common number, the program will
; just print one of the most common numbers.
