    ; Write a program that asks the user for a string. It then flips every letter
    ; from lower case to UPPER case and vice versa, and prints back the result to the
    ; user.

    ; Example:
      ; Input:  Hello
      ; Output: hELLO

    ; You may assume that the input is only made of letters. (No spaces or
    ; other punctuation marks).
