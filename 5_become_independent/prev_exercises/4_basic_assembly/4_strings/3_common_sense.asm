; 3.  Common sense
	
    ; Write a program that reads a string from the user, and then finds out the
    ; most common character in the string. (Don't count spaces).
    
    ; Finally the program prints that character back to the user, together with
    ; its number of occurrences in the string.
		
    ; Example:

      ; Input:  The summer is the place where all things find their winter

      ; Output: The character e is the most common character on the string.
              ; Amount of occurrences: 8
