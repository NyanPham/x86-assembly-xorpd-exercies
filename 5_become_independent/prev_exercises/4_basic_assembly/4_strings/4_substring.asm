; 4.  Substring

    ; Write a program that asks the user for two strings: s1,s2. 
    
    ; The program then searches for all the occurrences of s2 inside s1, and prints
    ; back to the user the locations of all the found occurrences.
	
    ; Example:
      
      ; Input:  s1 = 'the colors of my seas are always with me.'
              ; s2 = 'th'

      ; Search: s1 = 'the colors of my seas are always with me.'
                    ; th                                 th
                    ; 00000000000000001111111111111111222222222
                    ; 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef012345678

              ; 0
