; 0.  Diamond

    ; Write a program that asks the user for a number n, and then prints a
    ; "diamond" of size n, made of ASCII stars.

    ; Example:
      ; For n = 1 the expected result is:
	
       ; *
      ; ***
       ; *

      ; For n = 2 the expected result is:

        ; *
       ; ***
      ; *****
       ; ***
        ; *

    ; HINT: You could use tri.asm exercise from the code reading section as a
    ; basis for your program.
	
	; Can refactor later after learning subroutines and stack
