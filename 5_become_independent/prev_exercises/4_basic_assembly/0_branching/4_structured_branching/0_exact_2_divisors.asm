; 0. Write a program that takes the number n as input. Then it prints all the
; numbers x below n that have exactly 2 different integral divisors (Besides 1
; and x). 

; For example: 15 is such a number. It is divisible by 1,3,5,15. (Here 3 and 5
; are the two different divisiors, besides 1 and 15).

; However, 4 is not such a number. It is divisible by 1,2,4.
