; 1.  Bit counting:
    
; Write a program that takes a number (of size 4 bytes) x as input, and then
; counts the amount of "1" bits in even locations inside the number x. We
; assume that the rightmost bit has location 0, and the leftmost bit has a
; location of 31.

; Example:
; if x == {111011011}_2, then we only count the bits with stars under them.
		   ; * * * * *
		   ; 8 6 4 2 0 
; Hence we get the result of 4.
